# СИГМА

**СИГМА — Платформа за прозрачност на обществените поръчки** — a transparency-and-analysis platform for Bulgarian public procurement. СИГМА centralizes the full procurement lifecycle (planning → publication → bidding → evaluation → contract → execution) and layers AI checks on top: it flags rigged technical specifications, detects price anomalies against market indices, surfaces cartels and related-party networks, and publishes a public risk score for every tender.

Built as an analysis/transparency layer over the national procurement data (АОП / ЦАИС ЕОП), with open data for citizens, journalists, and NGOs.

The design is captured in [`docs/`](docs/) — start there:

- **Платформа за СИГМА** — concept overview, key functionality, roadmap.
- **Обща рамка, концепция, roadmap, законови промени** — architecture, the analysis/monitoring module, phased roadmap, and the legislative changes the platform assumes.
- **UX - СИГМА** — user journeys for the three personas: contracting authority (възложител), citizen (гражданин), and bidder (фирма-участник).

> These are early drafts. A consolidated `docs/specification.md` (mirroring the kolkostruva spec structure) will follow as scope firms up.

## Quick start

This repo is set up to be developed inside a Devcontainer — host machine needs Docker (or compatible: OrbStack, Rancher Desktop) and an editor with Devcontainer support (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.).

```bash
# Open the folder in your editor and "Reopen in Container"
# (or run `devcontainer up --workspace-folder .` from the CLI)

pnpm setup    # one-time per fresh checkout: install + local D1 + seed
pnpm dev      # daily: starts every Worker + frontend in parallel
```

> **Status:** prototype. The container, agent conventions, and design docs are in place; the TypeScript monorepo scaffold (`apps/`, `packages/`, workspace + lockfile) is still being established, so the `pnpm` commands below describe the intended flow rather than what runs today.

## Layout

СИГМА reuses the kolkostruva tech stack — a single TypeScript monorepo on Cloudflare's edge platform (pnpm + turbo; React Router v7 SSR on Workers; D1 + Durable Objects + Vectorize + Workers AI + Queues + KV + R2, fronted by AI Gateway). The intended top-level layout:

| Top-level dir        | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/`              | Cloudflare Workers — `web` (React Router SSR explorer; citizen / authority / bidder portals; reads D1 directly via `@sigma/db`) and `etl` (ingestion + analysis pipeline)                                                                                               |

| `data/`              | Source **АОП register exports** (`Храни.xlsx` — food-sector procurement, `Строителство.xlsx` — construction-sector), ~129k contract/lot rows; gitignored. Ingested into D1 by the `scripts/` pipeline — see [`docs/data-ingestion.md`](docs/data-ingestion.md)        |

The analysis/monitoring module (risk scoring 0–100, спец-checker AI, ценови аномалии, картелна детекция) is the heart of the system — see the architecture doc in `docs/`.

| `pnpm bootstrap:apply` | Actually create the resources                                   |
| `pnpm deploy`          | Run by CI on push to `main`; idempotent migrate + seed + deploy |

## ETL

The historical ЦАИС ЕОП base is loaded from the public EOP MinIO open-data feed by `scripts/load-eop.mjs`; `scripts/import.mjs` applies the local D1 migrations, loads the feed, and rebuilds derived tables. The feed base defaults to `https://storage.eop.bg` and can be overridden with `EOP_OPEN_DATA_BASE_URL`.

## Operational security

Production deploys originate only from GitHub Actions; the dev machine never holds a long-lived production credential. Procurement data is public by design, but integrations with national registries (НАП, Търговски регистър) carry access constraints — treat any credentials for those as production secrets.

## License

TBD before public release.
