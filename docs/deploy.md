# Deploying Sigma to Cloudflare

Sigma's deploy set is two Workers sharing one D1 **per environment**: **`sigma`** (the SSR
explorer — `apps/web`) and **`sigma-etl`** (the cron-triggered refresh Workflow — `apps/etl`).
`apps/api`, `apps/admin`, `apps/assistant` are out of v1 scope and need not be deployed.

The explorer reads D1 directly; the ETL writes to the **same** D1. Locally they share one miniflare
D1 (vite `persistState`); in the cloud they share it by binding the **same `database_id`**. The
committed `wrangler.*` files hold zero-UUID dummies (so local dev / miniflare works unchanged), and
the real ids **and** resource names come from **env vars at deploy time** — so the same source tree
deploys to any number of targets (production, staging, a second account) with no file edits.

## Environments

| | Production | Staging | Production-v2 (future) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web worker → URL | `sigma` → **sigma.midt.bg** (Access-gated; workers.dev off) | `sigma-stage` → sigma-stage.obecto.workers.dev (Access-gated) | new name, 3rd URL |
| ETL worker | `sigma-etl` (cron) | `sigma-etl-stage` (cron) | — |
| Workflow (account-global) | `sigma-refresh` | `sigma-refresh-stage` | — |
| D1 database | `sigma` | `sigma-stage` (**separate** DB) | own DB |
| CF account | obecto | obecto (shared, for now) | **separate** account |
| GitHub Environment | `production` | `staging` | `production` (repointed) |

Staging/dev rely on the automatic `workers.dev` hostname (naming the worker `sigma-stage` is all it
takes to serve `sigma-stage.obecto.workers.dev` — no routes to configure). **Production**
additionally gets the `sigma.midt.bg` custom domain and a Cloudflare Access gate before launch — see
*Gate before launch* (§6) below.

Each environment has its **own D1 database** (*same account ≠ same database*). Within an environment
web + etl share one D1 so the explorer reads what the ETL writes; across environments they never
touch.

## How it works — env-var rendering

A deploy never edits the committed `wrangler.*`. Each package's `deploy` script runs
`build → render → deploy`: [scripts/wrangler-render.mjs](../scripts/wrangler-render.mjs) reads env
vars and writes a throwaway, gitignored `wrangler.deploy.*` that `wrangler deploy --config` ships.

```
react-router build                                              # name:"sigma", id: 0000…0000
node scripts/wrangler-render.mjs build/server/wrangler.json     # read env vars → wrangler.deploy.json
wrangler deploy --config build/server/wrangler.deploy.json      # ship the rendered file
```

The only difference between a staging deploy and a production deploy is **which env-var values are
in scope**:

| env var | production | staging | consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | prod token | staging token | wrangler (auth) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | obecto | obecto (same, for now) | wrangler (auth) |
| `SIGMA_D1_ID` | prod D1 id | **staging D1 id** | render → `database_id` |
| `SIGMA_WEB_NAME` | *(unset → `sigma`)* | `sigma-stage` | render → web worker `name` |
| `SIGMA_ETL_NAME` | *(unset → `sigma-etl`)* | `sigma-etl-stage` | render → etl worker `name` |
| `SIGMA_WORKFLOW_NAME` | *(unset → `sigma-refresh`)* | `sigma-refresh-stage` | render → `[[workflows]] name` |
| `SIGMA_D1_NAME` | *(unset → `sigma`)* | `sigma-stage` | render → `database_name` **+** provisioning/seed scripts |

Every name var defaults to its committed value, so with all of them unset the render is
**byte-identical to today** (only `database_id` substituted) — the production-safety invariant.

> Render implementation: a fast path writes the sentinel-substituted string unchanged when no name
> var is set (preserving byte-identity and `.jsonc` comments). When a name var IS set, the web
> config (`.json`/`.jsonc`) is parsed → mutated → stringified, and the ETL config (`.toml`) is
> rewritten in place per field — `name`←`SIGMA_ETL_NAME`, `[[workflows]] name`←`SIGMA_WORKFLOW_NAME`,
> `database_name`←`SIGMA_D1_NAME`; `database_id` continues from the `SIGMA_D1_ID` sentinel.
> `class_name`/`binding` are never touched.

### Why explicit names (decision record)

Each resource gets its own env var rather than deriving names from one `-stage`-style suffix:

- **One source of truth for the D1 name.** `SIGMA_D1_NAME` is the *same* variable the
  provisioning/seed scripts ([bootstrap.mjs](../scripts/bootstrap.mjs),
  [import.mjs](../scripts/import.mjs), and the `load-*.mjs` loaders) use to target the D1 — and it
  also drives the rendered `database_name`. The deployed config therefore can't drift from the
  database you actually created/seeded.
- **Self-documenting and unconstrained.** A GitHub Environment lists exactly what it ships
  (`SIGMA_WEB_NAME=sigma-stage`, …) with no suffix arithmetic, and a future second-account
  production is free to use any names, not a forced `sigma-` base.

This is clean because the render script is **field-aware** — there is no ambiguity between the
worker `name` "sigma" and the `database_name` "sigma".

### Why GitHub Environments

The deploy job's `environment:` field selects which Environment's secrets/variables resolve, so the
*same* workflow ships to staging or production purely on which credentials + names are in scope.
Environments are also the natural home for the future separate-account production (just fill its
secrets) and for an optional manual approval gate on production.

## 0. Prerequisites (one-time)

- A Cloudflare account on the **Workers Paid** plan (needed for Workflows and a ~1.4 GB D1).
- A credential:
  - **CI (recommended):** an API token stored as a GitHub **Environment secret**
    (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`); the deploy runs from
    [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml). No long-lived credential on any
    developer machine (per AGENTS.md).
  - **Local (provisioning/seeding + optional manual deploy):** prefer `pnpm exec wrangler login`
    (an OAuth session — nothing to delete afterward) over a pasted token.

> **What CI does vs. what's one-time manual.** CI only **deploys** (`wrangler deploy`). It cannot run
> steps 1–2 below: provisioning produces the `database_id` that CI needs as a secret (chicken-and-egg),
> and the initial data load needs the gitignored `data/` corpus. Do steps 1–2 once, locally, per
> environment; thereafter CI deploys and the `sigma-etl` cron keeps the data fresh.

### Minimal API-token scopes

A custom token needs only these **Account**-level permissions (it cannot be scoped to a single
Worker — see *Notes → Access scoping*): Workers Scripts **Edit**, D1 **Edit**, Workflows **Edit**,
Account Settings **Read**. The same scopes cover both provisioning and deploy.

## 1. Provision the D1 (per environment, local)

Each environment gets its **own** database. `SIGMA_D1_NAME` selects the name (default `sigma`):

```bash
# production (default name)
pnpm bootstrap:apply                                          # → wrangler d1 create sigma

# staging
SIGMA_D1_NAME=sigma-stage node scripts/bootstrap.mjs --apply # → wrangler d1 create sigma-stage
```

Capture the printed **D1 `database_id`** and store it as that environment's `SIGMA_D1_ID`
secret — **not** in the committed `wrangler.*` files (which keep the zero-UUID dummy for local dev).

> `bootstrap.mjs` acts on whichever account `wrangler` is currently authenticated to, and only
> *creates* + prints the id (it doesn't wire it anywhere). If the database already exists the create
> fails-soft; read the id back with `wrangler d1 info <name>`.

## 2. Seed the data (per environment, local)

```bash
# production
node scripts/import.mjs --remote

# staging
SIGMA_D1_NAME=sigma-stage node scripts/import.mjs --remote
```

This migrates the schema, loads the EOP staging data (from the open `storage.eop.bg` feed —
overridable via `EOP_OPEN_DATA_BASE_URL`), derives amendments, loads FX rates + NUTS, normalizes to
the domain tables, and precomputes rollups + FTS.

> **`SIGMA_D1_NAME` keeps a seed off production.** `import.mjs` and **every** `load-*.mjs` loader
> target the database by name via `SIGMA_D1_NAME`; without it they default to `sigma`. Always set it
> when seeding a non-prod environment.

> **Bulk-load caveat.** Each step runs via `wrangler d1 execute --remote --file`, the only bulk path
> in wrangler 4.x (there is no `wrangler d1 import`). Slow but feasible over the API for the ~190k-row
> staging + domain tables — figure ~20 min for a fresh remote load. The full DB is ~1.4 GB incl.
> staging (within the 10 GB Paid limit). After the first load the cron Workflow keeps it fresh
> incrementally (it never reloads the base).

> **Two gotchas if you load from a sqlite `.dump`:** D1 rejects `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;`, `BEGIN
> TRANSACTION;`, `COMMIT;`, and `PRAGMA writable_schema = ON;` (the last is what `.dump` emits to
> recreate FTS5 virtual tables). Strip those lines, and rebuild `search_index` with the normal
> `INSERT INTO search_index ... SELECT ... FROM contracts` recipe from
> [scripts/precompute.sql](../scripts/precompute.sql) — don't ship FTS content via dump.

> Schema changes after the first load are applied out-of-band, per environment:
> `SIGMA_D1_NAME=sigma-stage wrangler d1 migrations apply sigma-stage --remote`. Deploys do not
> migrate or reload data.

## 3. Configure GitHub Environments

Create two Environments (repo Settings → Environments):

**`production`** (mirror of today's repo secrets, so prod behaviour is unchanged):
- secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `SIGMA_D1_ID` (prod)
- variables: *(none required — every name var defaults to its committed prod value)*

**`staging`**:
- secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (same account token is fine for now), `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
  (= obecto), `SIGMA_D1_ID` (the new `sigma-stage` D1)
- variables `SIGMA_WEB_NAME` = `sigma-stage`, `SIGMA_ETL_NAME` = `sigma-etl-stage`,
  `SIGMA_WORKFLOW_NAME` = `sigma-refresh-stage`, `SIGMA_D1_NAME` = `sigma-stage`

> The `production` Environment is **non-blocking** to create: even with `environment: production`
> set on the job, GitHub still exposes repository-level secrets, so production keeps deploying with
> today's repo secrets until you choose to move them into the Environment.

> Optional hardening: give `production` **required reviewers** so a prod deploy waits for a manual
> "Review deployments" click.

## 4. Deploy

The single workflow [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) maps the git
event → an environment and deploys both Workers:

- **Production** — push a version tag (cut a release):
  ```bash
  git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0          # → production
  ```
- **Staging** — run it by hand:
  ```bash
  gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=staging  # → staging  (or Actions tab → Run workflow)
  ```

The `deploy` job sets `environment: <target>`, so `${{ secrets.* }}` / `${{ vars.* }}` resolve from
the matching Environment, then it guards on the credentials, type-checks, and runs
`pnpm --filter @sigma/web run deploy` + `pnpm --filter @sigma/etl run deploy`. A per-environment
`concurrency` group keeps a staging build from blocking a production release.

> **Manual (one-off, optional):** with the right env vars sourced locally you can run the same
> `pnpm --filter @sigma/web run deploy` / `pnpm --filter @sigma/etl run deploy` from a machine — but
> CI is the intended path so credentials stay off laptops.

Deploying `apps/web` overwrites whatever currently serves that worker name (for production, the
static v1 mock at `sigma.obecto.workers.dev`) with the live SSR explorer. The ETL is necessarily a
separate worker — it carries the cron trigger and the `RefreshWorkflow` class.

## 5. Verify

- Open the worker URL (e.g. `https://sigma.obecto.workers.dev/` or
  `https://sigma-stage.obecto.workers.dev/`) — real totals (~190k contracts · ~50.8 bn €).
- Dashboard → **Workflows** → the env's refresh Workflow (`sigma-refresh` / `sigma-refresh-stage`)
  is listed. There is no public HTTP trigger; manual/backfill runs go through the Dashboard or
  `wrangler workflows trigger <name>`. The cron (`0 */6 * * *`) then refreshes unattended.
- Confirm production is **untouched** when you deploy staging (different worker + D1 + lane).

## 6. Gate before launch — Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)

Sigma is a public transparency portal, but both deployments are kept **private until release** behind
**Cloudflare Access**. Production (`sigma.midt.bg`) is gated **pre-launch** and opened at go-live
(no redeploy); staging stays gated permanently for the team.

> **Decision: Access, not an in-worker password gate.** An earlier plan gated *inside* the worker (a
> KV `published` flag + Basic Auth) because Access couldn't protect a `workers.dev` URL and v1 had no
> custom domain. Both premises changed — production now uses the `sigma.midt.bg` custom domain, and
> Cloudflare added one-click Access for `workers.dev` too. Access is the stronger choice: it runs at
> the edge (before the worker *and* the cache), gives real identity / SSO / audit, and **covers
> static assets** (no soft-vs-hard-gate tradeoff), with no application code. The in-worker gate is
> retired.

**Prerequisite.** `midt.bg` must be a Cloudflare **zone in the same account** as the `sigma` worker —
Workers Custom Domains and self-hosted Access apps attach to a zone you control. If its DNS isn't on
Cloudflare yet, add the domain and switch nameservers (or delegate `sigma.midt.bg`).

**a. Put the worker on the hostname.** Workers & Pages → `sigma` → Settings → Domains & Routes →
Add → **Custom Domain** → `sigma.midt.bg` (Cloudflare auto-creates the DNS record + TLS cert).
Config equivalent: `"routes": [{ "pattern": "sigma.midt.bg", "custom_domain": true }]` — but attach
it out-of-band for now so it doesn't also fire on the `sigma-stage` deploy (see the `workers_dev`
note below).

**b. Protect it with Access.** Zero Trust dashboard (`one.dash.cloudflare.com`, free up to 50 users)
→ Access → Applications → **Add → Self-hosted**:
- Application domain: subdomain `sigma`, domain `midt.bg` (path blank = whole site).
- Policy → **Allow**, Include = your people: an *Emails* list, *Emails ending in* `@obecto.com`, or
  an identity-provider group.
- Login method: Cloudflare's built-in **One-time PIN** (emailed code) works with no IdP; add Google /
  Microsoft Entra / GitHub under Settings → Authentication for SSO.

**c. Close the bypass.** Disable `workers.dev` for the prod worker (**`workers_dev = false`**, or turn
the route off in the dashboard) — otherwise `sigma.<sub>.workers.dev` stays a public backdoor around
the gate. This is the step people forget.

**Test.** `https://sigma.midt.bg` → redirected to the Access login → site; an off-list email is
denied; the `workers.dev` URL no longer responds.

**Go public at launch (no redeploy).** Delete the `sigma.midt.bg` Access application, or set its
policy to **Bypass / Everyone**. Staging keeps its own app, so the team preview stays private; re-gate
prod anytime by restoring the policy.

**Staging gate.** Same idea — one-click *Enable Cloudflare Access* on `sigma-stage.<sub>.workers.dev`
(Settings → Domains & Routes), or give staging `staging.sigma.midt.bg` + its own Access app.

> **`workers_dev` is per-environment.** Prod wants `false` (gated custom domain); staging on
> workers.dev wants `true`. So either give staging its own custom subdomain (both `false`, one
> committed value) or make `workers_dev` an env-driven render value like the names — **don't** commit
> a blanket `workers_dev: false`, or you'll knock staging's workers.dev URL offline.

> **Bypass for automation / IaC.** If something must reach gated prod (uptime check, etc.), add a
> **Service Token** policy or an IP bypass. The Access app + policy can also be managed as code
> (Terraform `cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application` / `_policy`) instead of click-ops. The ETL
> needs nothing here — `sigma-etl` is cron-only with no public surface.

## Isolation guarantees — why staging can't touch production

Three independent walls; any one is sufficient:

1. **Different worker names.** A staging render produces `sigma-stage` / `sigma-etl-stage`;
   `wrangler deploy` only overwrites the worker named in its config — it cannot write to `sigma`.
2. **Different D1.** Staging binds the `sigma-stage` id; prod's `sigma` DB is never named in a
   staging render. The seed/provision scripts (`import.mjs` + every `load-*.mjs`) target the DB by
   name via `SIGMA_D1_NAME` — without it they default to `sigma`, so that variable is the guard that
   keeps a seed off production.
3. **Different credentials / lane.** Staging uses the `staging` Environment's secrets and the
   `deploy-staging` concurrency group. When production-v2 moves to its own account, the account
   boundary becomes a fourth wall: a staging token has no access to the prod account at all.

## Data & the ETL cron caveat

There are **two** ETL sources with opposite reachability:

- **Historical bulk** ([scripts/load-eop.mjs](../scripts/load-eop.mjs)) → `https://storage.eop.bg`
  (overridable via `EOP_OPEN_DATA_BASE_URL`). **Open** → the seed in step 2 just works.
- **Go-forward 2026+ delta** ([scripts/load-ocds.mjs](../scripts/load-ocds.mjs) and the on-platform
  ingest in [packages/ingest](../packages/ingest)) → `https://data.egov.bg/api`. **IP-restricted**
  (403 from non-BG egress).

The deployed cron `RefreshWorkflow` ([apps/etl/src/index.ts](../apps/etl/src/index.ts)) pulls the
**OCDS / `data.egov.bg`** delta — *not* storage.eop.bg. So the cron (prod **and** staging) will
**idle on errors** from Cloudflare egress until either the planned **BG egress proxy** for
`data.egov.bg` lands, or the Worker's ingester is repointed at the open `storage.eop.bg` feed (a
separate ETL change). The seeded through-2025 data is unaffected meanwhile. Consider staggering the
staging schedule (e.g. `30 */6 * * *`) so it doesn't hit the source at the same minute as prod.

## Notes

- **Runtime secrets.** The explorer needs none (read-only public data; OCDS reads need no key). The
  **ETL** has no runtime secret and no public HTTP surface — it runs cron-only and cannot be
  triggered over the internet. The `.dev.vars` secrets remain for AI gateway / Anthropic and
  national-registry credentials used by ETL/ingest and the planned assistant.
- **Access scoping.** Cloudflare API tokens scope by permission + account, **not** down to one Worker
  script (`Workers Scripts: Edit` is account-wide). For true "only-Sigma" isolation, put the Sigma
  workers in their own Cloudflare account and scope the token to it (this is the production-v2 plan).
  Otherwise use the minimal scopes above and keep the token in CI rather than on a laptop.
- **Page caching** is done via `Cache-Control` headers + the per-colo Cache API
  ([apps/web/app/lib/cache.ts](../apps/web/app/lib/cache.ts)) — no KV namespace needed. The Worker
  normalizes cache keys to the query params the loaders consume, so unknown query params collapse
  onto the same cached entry instead of forcing fresh D1 aggregation. D1 is the only Cloudflare
  resource Sigma provisions. Full CSV exports are streamed without edge caching and are protected by
  the `CSV_RATE_LIMITER` Workers Rate Limiting binding (10/60s); `/companies` and `/authorities`
  cache misses are protected by `AGG_RATE_LIMITER` (30/60s).
- **Custom-domain checklist.** In production the Worker redirects cleartext HTTP to HTTPS before
  route handling. For the production custom domain, set Minimum TLS Version 1.2, enable Always Use
  HTTPS, submit/verify HSTS preload, and optionally add a case-insensitive WAF rate rule on `*.csv`
  as a zone-level backstop (not available on `workers.dev`).

## Production-v2 (future, separate account)

No code change: create the `production` Environment with the new account's
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` / `SIGMA_D1_ID`, set its name vars (leave unset to
keep `sigma`/`sigma-etl`/…, or set explicit names for a distinct identity), provision + seed its D1
the same way, and deploy. The env-var rendering already supports N targets.

## Open items

- **Staging trigger** is manual `workflow_dispatch`; flip to push-to-`main` (uncomment the
  `push: { branches: [main] }` trigger) if continuous staging is wanted.
- **Cron freshness** depends on the `data.egov.bg` egress fix (BG proxy or EOP-repoint) — tracked
  separately from this deploy work.
- Whether to add a **required-reviewers** gate on the `production` Environment.
- **Access gate** (§6) is manual infra (zone + custom domain + Access app). Decide the `workers_dev`
  wiring: give staging its own custom subdomain, or make `workers_dev` an env-driven render value.
